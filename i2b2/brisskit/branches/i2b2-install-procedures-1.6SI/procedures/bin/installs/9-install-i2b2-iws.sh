# Installs the 'i2b2' WS that acts as an interface between CiviCRM and i2b2.:
#
# Mandatory: the I2B2_INSTALL_PROCS_HOME environment variable to be set.
# Optional : the I2B2_INSTALL_WORKSPACE environment variable.
# The latter is an optional full path to a workspace area. If not set, defaults to a workspace
# within the install home.
#
# Pre-reqs:
#   1-acquisitions.sh has been run at some point to acquire the install artifacts.
#
# USAGE: {script-file-name}.sh job-name
# Where: 
#   job-name is a suitable tag to group all jobs associated with the overall workflow
# Notes:
#   The job-name is used to create a work directory for the overall workflow; eg:
#   I2B2_INSTALL_PROCS_HOME/job-name
#   This work directory must already exist.
