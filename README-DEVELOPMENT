Inspect the POM.
================

There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions)... 

To build a production artifact, the default install invocation is sufficient...
mvn clean install

To build a development artifact...
mvn clean install -Denvironment.type=development

The development version has facilities for dropping all sql artifacts. 
Hence you must explicitly request a development build.

NOTES:
======
(1) For development testing, the lib directory needs to be populated.
    Do a maven install and then unzip the artifact's lib directory.
(2) The stopping and starting of JBoss needs looking at.
(3) The Oracle parts have been left in place, but ARE OUT OF DATE.
    I've left them in situ because I understand that the Oracle
    settings may well be close to Postgres (as and when an i2b2 version
    supporting Postgres becomes available).
